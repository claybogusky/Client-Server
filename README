Iâ€™ll demonstrate a simple UNIX (Linux/MacOS/etc) socket program that uses sockets to create a chat 
between a client and server. Before you read further into this, I recommend reading up on  socket programming 
and a bit on the layers of the internet for background. As this program uses UNIX system calls, again, its best to 
have background on that as well.

Essentially, this program will be a mock instant messaging program that will communicate over TCP using sockets. 
The client will connect to the server through an IP address specified. The server will listen for up to 5 requests 
at a time. Afterwards, the server will accept the request to connect from a client and messages will be sent back and 
forth through a buffer. Should either the client or server decide to stop, at the end we close the sockets and 
terminate the program.

How to run this...

In a terminal compile and execute the server code.

    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$ g++ server.cpp
    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$ mv a.out server
    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$ ./server 12345
    Waiting for a client to connect...
    Connected with client!
    Awaiting client response...
    Client: Hello SERVER!
    >Hello CLIENT!
    Awaiting client response...
    Client: Live Long And Prosper!
    >You too!
    Awaiting client response...
    Client has quit the session
    ********Session********
    Bytes written: 21 Bytes read: 39
    Elapsed time: 230 secs
    Connection closed...
    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$ 


In a SEPARATE terminal compile and execute the client code.

    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$ g++ client.cpp
    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$ mv a.out client
    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$ ./client 127.0.0.1 12345
    Connected to the server!
    >Hello SERVER!
    Awaiting server response...
    Server: Hello CLIENT!
    >Live Long And Prosper!
    Awaiting server response...
    Server: You too!
    >>exit
    ********Session********
    Bytes written: 35 Bytes read: 32781
    Elapsed time: 230 secs
    Connection closed
    Clays-MBP:Client-Server claybogusky$
